# NetApp Instaclustr Code Samples

## Description

This repository is where we share code samples from our blog posts, YouTube videos, conference presentations, and more. While this code is not supported and you should make sure to read and understand the code before executing in your own environments, it is an easy way for users to try new demos and learn more about the technologies.

## Projects

Each technology has its own folder hierarchy. Multi-tech demos that span multiple technologies are committed to the folder of the primary technology, with the README defining the additional technologies used.

|------------|---------|-------------|
| **Cadence** | [CadenceKafka](./Cadence/CadenceKafka/) | Cadence-Kafka integration using signals and activity completions |
| **Cadence** | [CadenceKafkaDroneDeliveryDemo](./Cadence/CadenceKafkaDroneDeliveryDemo/) | Drone delivery demo with Cadence workflows and Kafka messaging |
| **ClickHouse** | [Stream Processing Part 1](./ClickHouse/stream%20processing/part%201/) | ClickHouse as a stream processor with SQL joins and time windows |
| **Kafka** | [KafkaConnectPostgresqlSinkConnector](./Kafka/KafkaConnectPostgresqlSinkConnector/) | Custom Kafka Connect sink connector for JSON to PostgreSQL |
| **Kafka** | [KafkaML](./Kafka/KafkaML/) | Streaming CSV data for incremental ML experiments with concept drift |

| **Kafka** | [TieredStorage](./Kafka/TieredStorage/) | Interactive sizing calculators for Kafka tiered storage |
| **Kafka** | [data-processing-pipeline](./Kafka/data-processing-pipeline/) | Zero-code real-time Tide Data Processing Pipeline with Kafka Connect |
| **PostgreSQL** | [Postgres-ANF](./Postgres/Postgres-ANF/) | Performance test scripts for PostgreSQL on Azure NetApp Files |
| **ZooKeeper** | [Dining Philosophers](./Zookeeper/zookeeper-meets-Dining-Philosophers/) | Classic Dining Philosophers solved with ZooKeeper distributed locks |
