# Instaclustr by NetApp Code Samples

This repository has been created to share code samples from our blog posts, YouTube videos, conference presentations, and more. While this code is not supported and you should make sure to read and understand the code before executing in your own environments, it is an easy way for users to try new demos and learn more about the technologies.

## Features

Each technology will have it's own folder hierarchy. There will be multi-tech demos that span multiple technologies but will be committed to the folder of the primary technology, with an updated Readme defining the additional technologies used.

## Getting Started

Each code sample will have a getting-started section and an examples section to help you use the code.

## Conclusion

We hope you enjoy these samples!
