Example ClickHouse SQL code for part of the blog "All I want for Christmas is…another real-time stream processing technology—ClickHouse!"

This is my first experiemnt with ClickHouse, where I'm attempting to use it as a Stream Processing system instead of Kafka Streams or RisingWave.

I will try and implement the stream processing logic from my earlier blog “An Apache Kafka and RisingWave Stream Processing Christmas Special” available here https://www.instaclustr.com/blog/apache-kafka-and-risingwave-stream-processing/

This first part focusses on the SQL logic (joins and time windows) using static data - check out the blog HERE TODO
