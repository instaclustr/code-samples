# Apache Kafka Code Samples

## Description

The following folders contain code samples related to [Apache Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org/) on NetApp Instaclustr. These samples cover a range of Kafka use cases including connectors, stream processing, machine learning data streaming, tiered storage sizing, and new Kafka 4.0 features.

## Projects

| Project | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| [KafkaConnectPostgresqlSinkConnector](./KafkaConnectPostgresqlSinkConnector/) | Custom Kafka Connect sink connector for writing JSON to PostgreSQL |
| [KafkaML](./KafkaML/) | CSV streaming data and Python script for incremental ML experiments with concept drift |
| [Kafka_4.0](./Kafka_4.0/) | Examples demonstrating the Kafka 4.0 next-generation Consumer Rebalance Protocol |
| [TieredStorage](./TieredStorage/) | Interactive HTML calculators for Kafka tiered storage sizing and cost analysis |
| [data-processing-pipeline](./data-processing-pipeline/) | Zero-code real-time Tide Data Processing Pipeline configs using Kafka Connect |

## Getting Started

Each sample has its own README that describes the sample, any prerequisites, examples, and anything else relevant to the code.

### Prerequisites

- Apache Kafka cluster (e.g., [Instaclustr managed Apache Kafka](https://www.instaclustr.com/products/apache-kafka/))
- Additional prerequisites vary per project — see individual READMEs

## Additional Materials

Each README will also include a link to a blog post, YouTube video, or conference presentation to provide more context and additional information.
