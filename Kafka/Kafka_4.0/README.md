# Kafka 4.0 New Features
## The Next Generation Consumer Rebalance Protocol

The following examples are from the blog "Rebalance your Apache Kafka partitions with the next generation Consumer Rebalance Protocol â€” up to 20x faster!" TODO Link once published

Example bash script for rebalance performance testing.  For this to work you need bash and Kafka 4.0 downloaded on your local computer, and either Kafka 4.0 running locally or a managed service such as NetApp Instaclustr's Kafka service running version 4.0.

Example Java consumer code for the new "consumer" protocol. 
To run it you need a Kafka 4.0 cluster and Kafka 4.0 clients.
